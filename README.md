    This project contains proto files. These files and special maven plugins are used for generating 
    java classes. So, before running these two applications (sever and client) you need to run maven 
    package lifeCycle to generate additional java classes. After this you can run server and client.

    Choose different snippet of code in Client and ServerApp classes to perform simple request or 
    data streaming.
